We welcome contributions!

Due to the fact that we intend to release Uplift on the Unity Asset Store, we will need to address copyright properly.

We haven't yet decided if we go for a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) or a [Developer's Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/).

We will most probably decide this when we get our first external contribution, if any! So before you start, please take contact with us to discuss this.

Thanks!

The DragonBox team
