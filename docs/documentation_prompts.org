* .meta file handling
** GUIDs
*** When they are created
*** How they are created
    - Based on path and content
    - Different across different computers (i.e. not recreatable)
*** How they are handled
    - Not changed when moving
*** Impact on Uplift and overall workflow
*** Not fully researched - effect of directory .meta files
** Dealing with GUID fragility
   - Source controlling .meta
   - Future: Possible tool for tracking GUID changes (for example, when replacing assets)
