    - Upbring.xml to contain listing for files A1, A2, A3 under Package A
** Comments
   - As repository R isn't subject of test, it doesn't matter which type is it

* Suite: Customized File Location
** Given
*** Package C
    - With version 1.3.5 and shortname "package_c"
    - With files C1, C2
    - With MEDIA files Media/M1, Media/M2
    - With EXAMPLE files Example/E1, Example/E2, Example/Adv/E3
** Scenario

*** Expect
    - Directory UPackages/package_c~1.3.5 to contain: C1, C2,
      Media/M1, Media/M2, Example/E1, Example/E2, Example/Adv/E3
    - Directory Assets/UPackages/package_c~1.3.5 to contain: C1, C2,
      Media/M1, Media/M2, Example/E1, Example/E2, Example/Adv/E3
** Scenario
*** When launching "Install Dependencies"
*** When Upfile.xml Path Configuration defines
    - MediaPath to be Assets/Media
    - ExamplesPath to be Examples
*** Expect
    - Directory UPackages/package_c~1.3.5 to contain: C1, C2,
      Media/M1, Media/M2, Example/E1, Example/E2, Example/Adv/E3
    - Directory Assets/UPackages/package_c~1.3.5 to contain:
      C1, C2
    - Directory Assets/Media to contain
      package_c~1.3.5/M1, package_c~1.3.5/M2
    - Directory Examples to contain:
      package_c~1.3.5/E1, package_c~1.3.5/E2, package_c~1.3.5/Adv/E3
** Scenario
*** When launching "Install Dependencies"
*** When Upfile.xml Path Configuration defines
    - MediaPath to be Assets/Media
    - ExamplesPath to be Examples
    - MediaPath with SkipPackageStructure set to TRUE
    - ExamplesPath with SkipPackageStructure set to TRUE
*** Expect
    - Directory UPackages/package_c~1.3.5 to contain: C1, C2,
      Media/M1, Media/M2, Example/E1, Example/E2
    - Directory Assets/UPackages/package_c~1.3.5 to contain:
      C1, C2
    - Directory Assets/Media to contain
      M1, M2
    - Directory Examples to contain:
      E1, E2, Adv/E3

** Comments
   - Note - above examples are not yet fully implemented.
   - One notable behaviour here is that we unwind the package to the
     common root, meaning files with paths:
     A/B/C/D/1, A/B/2, A/B/C/3 are going to be unwound as
     C/D/1, 2, C/3 respectively

* Suite: CLI Usage
** Given ANY SCENARIO
** Expect
   - ANY UI interaction to be launchable directly from CLI
** Comments
   - Interaction doesn't mean feedback. So, for example, we don't need
     to list outdated packages. We just need to be sure, that we can
     update either targeted or all packages.
   - For consistency we should be able to do this when Unity is actually disabled.
